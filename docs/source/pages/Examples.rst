LBM Poiseuille Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We define the simulation domain for the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). In this example, we choose a resolution of 30×30×30. Periodic boundary conditions are applied along the XX and YY axes, while the ZZ axis remains non-periodic.

.. code-block:: yaml

   do_domain:
     - domain:
        bounds: [[0,0,0],[0.1,0.1,0.1]]
        resolution: 30
        periodic: [true, true, false]

We apply two Neumann boundary conditions on the Z axis, (setting to `(ux = 0, uy = 0, uz = 0)`):

.. code-block:: yaml

   boundary_conditions:
     - neumann_z_l:
        U: [0.0,0,0]
     - neumann_z_0:
        U: [0.0,0,0]


An external force of `(9.512485×10−5,0.0,0.0)` is applied to drive the flow. The kinematic viscosity is set to `1e−3`, and the average density is assumed to be `1000`.

.. code-block:: yaml

   set_lbm_parameters:
     - lbm_parameters:
        Fext: [9.512485e-05,0.000000e+00,0.000000e+00]
        nuth: 1e-3

The global parameters for this simulation include output frequency and the total number of iterations:

.. code-block:: yaml

   global:
      simulation_paraview_freq: 100
      simulation_end_iteration: 3000

The expected results should show the development of a fully developed Poiseuille flow profile along the Z axis, with velocity increasing towards the center and decreasing near the boundaries due to the imposed Neumann conditions.
